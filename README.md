# Starmus Audio Recorder

**A mobile-first audio recording and annotation plugin for WordPress, designed for low-bandwidth environments.**

The **Starmus Audio Recorder** provides a comprehensive solution for capturing, managing, and annotating user-submitted audio content. Its core feature is a chunked uploader with an offline queue, ensuring recordings are never lost‚Äîeven with intermittent internet connections.

The plugin is built to be **highly extensible**, offering developers a rich set of WordPress hooks for custom metadata handling, conditional logic, and pre/post-processing.

Named after the iconic **Starmus Festival**, where rock legends and astrophysicists share the stage, this tool is built for creators and communities who believe **voice has gravity**.
