# Security Policy – AiWA Governance Repository

This document defines the security reporting and disclosure policy for the AiWA Governance Repository, which may contain culturally sensitive, ethically governed, and AI-training related data and code.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not file a public issue**. Instead, please report it confidentially to our security team:

- 📧 Email: [security@aiwestafrica.com](mailto:security@aiwestafrica.com)
- 📧 Legal escalation: [legal@aiwestafrica.com](mailto:legal@aiwestafrica.com)

Please include:

- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots
- Your name and contact information (optional but appreciated)

## Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure**. If you report a vulnerability in good faith:

- You will not be subject to legal action for your disclosure
- We will acknowledge your report within **5 business days**
- We aim to patch critical issues within **15 business days**
- You may be publicly credited with consent after resolution

## Scope

The following are in scope:

- All repositories under [AiWA-Ai-West-Africa](https://github.com/AiWA-Ai-West-Africa)
- Scripts or workflows used in GitHub Actions
- Sensitive AI training data pipelines or governance mechanisms

The following are out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of Service (DoS) without actual exploit
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies unless demonstrably exploitable in this repo

## Special Considerations for Culturally Sensitive Data

Many assets in this repository are bound by **dual-consent and community governance protocols**. Unauthorized access, exfiltration, or tampering may trigger legal action under:

- **California and Gambian law**
- Customary rights frameworks recognized by indigenous and oral tradition authorities

Any breach involving these materials may be deemed a **cultural and legal violation**.

## Enforcement & Legal

Violations of this policy or bad-faith actions may result in:

- **Account suspension**
- **Revocation of access**
- **Notification to platform security teams**
- **Pursuit of civil or criminal liability under applicable laws**

All legal disputes are subject to the jurisdiction of **San Diego County, California**.
