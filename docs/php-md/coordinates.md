## Description

STARISIAN TECHNOLOGIES CONFIDENTIAL
© 2023–2025 Starisian Technologies. All Rights Reserved.
Main bootstrapper for the Starmus Audio Recorder plugin lifecycle.
@package   Starisian\Sparxstar\Starmus
@since     0.1.0
@version 0.9.2

## Methods

### `starmus_get_instance()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Get singleton instance of the plugin.
Creates and returns the single instance of this class using lazy initialization.
Subsequent calls return the same instance without re-initialization.
This is the primary way to access the plugin instance throughout the codebase.
@since  0.1.0
@return StarmusAudioRecorder The singleton instance.

### `starmus_run()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Entry point called from main plugin file.
Bootstraps the plugin by ensuring the singleton instance is created and initialized.
This method is called by the 'plugins_loaded' WordPress action hook with priority 20
to ensure SCF/ACF (priority 5) is already loaded.
This is the main entry point for the entire plugin and should only be called once.
@since 0.1.0

### `check_field_plugin_dependency()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Check whether Secure Custom Fields (SCF) or Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is active.
The recorder relies on one of these field frameworks to manage submission metadata
and custom field definitions. SCF exposes ACF-compatible global utility functions
such as acf_get_instance(), which serves as the authoritative presence signal.
This check is performed before plugin initialization to ensure graceful failure
if the required dependency is not available.
@since  0.1.0
@return bool True when a supported field framework is available, false otherwise.

### `displayRuntimeErrorNotice()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Display collected runtime errors as admin notices.
Shows non-fatal errors that occurred during plugin execution as dismissible
admin notices. Only visible to users with 'manage_options' capability.
Errors are deduplicated before display to prevent notice spam.
Called via 'admin_notices' action hook in admin context only.
@since 0.1.0

### `__clone()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Strictly prevent cloning of singleton instance.
Ensures singleton pattern integrity by preventing object cloning,
which would create multiple instances and violate the singleton contract.
@since  0.1.0
@throws LogicException Always - cloning is not allowed.
@return void

### `__wakeup()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Strictly prevent unserialization of singleton instance.
Prevents recreation of singleton instance through unserialization,
which would bypass the singleton pattern and constructor logic.
@since  0.1.0
@throws LogicException Always - unserialization is not allowed.
@return void

### `__sleep()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Strictly prevent serialization of singleton instance.
Prevents singleton instance from being serialized, which could
lead to unserialization and violation of the singleton pattern.
@since  0.1.0
@throws LogicException Always - serialization is not allowed.
@return array Never returns - always throws exception.

### `__serialize()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Strictly prevent serialization of singleton instance (PHP 7.4+ method).
Modern PHP serialization prevention method that works alongside __sleep().
Prevents singleton instance from being serialized using the newer PHP API.
@since  0.8.5
@throws LogicException Always - serialization is not allowed.
@return array Never returns - always throws exception.

### `__unserialize()`

**Visibility:** `public`

Strictly prevent unserialization of singleton instance (PHP 7.4+ method).
Modern PHP unserialization prevention method that works alongside __wakeup().
Prevents recreation of singleton instance through the newer PHP unserialize API.
@since  0.8.5
@param array<string, mixed> $data Serialized data (ignored).
@throws LogicException Always - unserialization is not allowed.
